## How to Use the Calendar GUI

- You can switch between **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **Schedule** views using the tabs at the top of the screen.

- Use the **left and right arrow buttons** to navigate:
  - In **Day View**, arrows move one day at a time.
  - In **Week View**, arrows move one week at a time.
  - In **Month View**, arrows move one month at a time.

- Click the **"Add Event"** button at the top of the screen to create a new event.

- To make an **All Day Event**, do not check the "Specify end time" checkbox.  
  > Note: When "Specify end time" is not selected, you cannot manually enter an end time.

- In **Day**, **Week**, and **Schedule** views, clicking an existing event will open a **popup window** showing its details.  
  - You can view the event's **subject**, **start time**, and **end time**.
  - If provided, **location** and **description** will also appear.

- In the event detail popup, you can click **"Edit"** to modify the selected event.  
  - Changes will be applied immediately after editing.

- To close the event detail popup, click either the **"Close"** button or the **X icon in the top-left corner**.

- If an invalid input is provided, an **error message popup** will appear.  
  - You can dismiss it by clicking the **"OK"** button or the **X icon in the top-left corner**.
