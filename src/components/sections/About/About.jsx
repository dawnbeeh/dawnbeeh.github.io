    <p>
    Lately, I've been exploring internship opportunities and thinking about what areas of software truly excite me.
    I'm still in the process of figuring things out, but I've been enjoying the chance to learn and try new things.
    With summer break giving me a bit more breathing room, Iâ€™m taking this time to move at my own pace - and I'm grateful for it.
